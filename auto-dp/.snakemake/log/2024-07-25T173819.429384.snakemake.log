MissingOutputException in rule produce_c_code_aux in file /home/remipoul/LIX_WORK/pwb/auto-dp/workflow/Snakefile, line 40:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/c_code/auto_dp.c (missing locally, parent dir contents: H2_folding.c, K4_folding.c, K5_folding.c, K_folding.c, L_folding.c, M_folding.c, aux.c, aux.h, C5_folding.c)
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
